# Introduction

<h2 id="#heading-id">Deep Chat is a framework agnostic chat component built to bring AI based APIs to life</h2>

### Vision

Building a chat component that can interact with a remote service is no easy feat. This is a challenge that we took on with full force, delivering
a web component that can connect to any service with minimal effort.

No two chat components are ever the same. We understand that your APIs have unique requirements and your websites demand controlled UX.
This is why Deep Chat is built to be fully customizable; from interactive features to creative design choices - it comes packed with tools to create
the chat experience you desire.

Developers are what brings this component to life; this is why Deep Chat is shipped in a cross-framework plug-and-play package to allow anyone to get started in just a few seconds
no matter what platform they use! Also, through careful analysis of their feedback, we place them directly on the driving seat in helping us decide what future improvements the component
will need.

### Open source

Open source is at the heart of what we do. Deep Chat is built by the community - for the community. All contributions to this [**project**](https://github.com/OvidijusParsiunas/deep-chat) are welcome!

If you have any suggestions for enhancements, ideas on how to take the project further or have discovered a bug, do not hesitate to create a new [**issue ticket**](https://github.com/OvidijusParsiunas/deep-chat/issues/new) and we will look into it as soon as possible!
